**Introduction**
As cyber threats continue to evolve, organizations must stay vigilant against the latest techniques used by cybercriminals and nation-state actors. The Emerging Cyber Threats 2023 repository aims to provide an overview of the significant threats that have emerged or grown in prevalence throughout the year. This information will help security teams and enterprises prepare for and respond to these risks.

**Emerging Threats**
Here is an overview of the major emerging cyber threats identified in 2023:

AI-Powered Attacks:
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyberattacks is on the rise, enabling faster, more targeted, and more sophisticated attacks, including automated phishing campaigns and AI-driven malware.

Ransomware Evolution:
Ransomware attacks have become more advanced in 2023, with double-extortion tactics where cybercriminals steal and threaten to release data in addition to encrypting it.

Supply Chain Attacks:
Attackers are increasingly targeting third-party vendors, service providers, and software suppliers to gain access to larger organizations, often exploiting vulnerabilities in the software development lifecycle.

Cloud Security Risks:
Misconfigurations, weak access controls, and vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure remain a significant concern, particularly with the increased adoption of cloud services in organizations.

Credential Stuffing and Identity Theft:
With an increased number of data breaches, attackers are exploiting stolen credentials through credential stuffing and other identity theft techniques to access sensitive information.

IoT Vulnerabilities:
The growing number of connected IoT devices presents new security risks, with many devices lacking sufficient security protections, making them easy targets for botnets and other attacks.

Deepfake Technology:
The use of deepfake technology for social engineering, fraud, and misinformation campaigns has become a growing concern, especially in cases where attackers impersonate key individuals.

Zero-Day Exploits:
Attackers continue to exploit unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in popular software and hardware, often targeting them before a patch can be released.

Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure:
Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure sectors like healthcare, energy, and government continue to rise, with actors aiming to disrupt services or cause widespread damage.

Nation-State Cyberattacks:
Geopolitical tensions have led to an increase in cyberattacks sponsored by nation-states, focused on espionage, stealing sensitive data, or sabotaging critical systems.
